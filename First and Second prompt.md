# First Message for Part 1 #

 - I’d like to begin development work on the Xbox Machine Controller project (repo here
).
- The repository already contains two working programs:
xbox_reader.cpp → Streams Xbox controller input over a Windows named pipe with an htop-style UI.
- xbox_pipe_reader.py → Connects to the pipe and parses JSON controller states for downstream use.
- The system works on Windows, but I now want to refactor and extend it for cross-platform use.

First task:
- Refactor xbox_reader.cpp so that controller input goes through an input abstraction layer. For now, the only backend will be XInput (Windows), but the design should allow plugging in alternatives later (e.g., SDL2, Linux evdev, macOS IOKit/HID). The main loop, JSON output, and UI should remain unchanged — only the controller input logic should be abstracted.

- Please generate a refactored version of xbox_reader.cpp that:
- Preserves the current behavior (same UI, same JSON output, same named pipe).
- Adds a clean input abstraction (interface class or similar).
- Keeps the existing license and comments intact.

# Second Task: Python Transport Abstraction #
- Now that the C++ side has an input abstraction layer, we want to extend the Python interface (xbox_pipe_reader.py) to support multiple transport mechanisms beyond the Windows named pipe.

Goals:
- Refactor the Python program so that all transport-specific logic is isolated in a Transport interface or class hierarchy.
- Keep the current behavior (read JSON snapshots from a named pipe) unchanged, but implement it as one concrete transport class (e.g., PipeTransport).
- Design the interface so that future transports (BLE, UART/Serial, TCP/IP, CAN bus, I²C, etc.) can be added with minimal changes to the core program.
- Preserve all current error handling, UTF-8 decoding, and JSON parsing logic.
- Keep the program Python 3 compatible and maintain readability/extensibility.

Deliverable:
- A fully refactored xbox_pipe_reader.py using the new transport abstraction.
- Example usage showing the existing named pipe transport working as before.
- Well-commented code explaining where to add new transports in the future.
